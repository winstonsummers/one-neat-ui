## Color Scheme

### Primary Scheme

- #F5F6F8 -- DESERT STORM -- Light shades
- #86878D -- OSLO GRAY -- Light accent
- #8A5F2D -- POTTERS CLAY -- Main brand color
- #BC9261 -- MUDDY WATERS -- Dark accent
- #242A3C -- EBONY CLAY -- Dark shades

These are the colors we will use for backgrounds and shades and text and so on. the primary colors that users will know our site by (not to mention have to stare at a lot if they like our app). Keeping that in mind we selected colors that reminded us of drinking whiskey; warm browns and tans like drinks, dark blue and light grey like labels. colors that would be easy and pleasant to read from.

### Action Scheme

- #8a5f2d -- Mule Fawn -- Primary
- #242a3c -- Ebony Clay -- Info
- #5f9746 -- Fruit Salad -- Success
- #dc870e -- Golden Bell -- Warning
- #f44336 -- Pomegranate -- Danger

These colors will be the do something colors. For buttons and links and tooltips and anything the user is looking to be slightly different so they can press the button and get what they are looking for. Not so much contrast that they become straining, but enough to be understandable. Not to say we wont use some of the Primary Scheme's, but that these are extra colors to add clarity of intent.
