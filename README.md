# One Neat Whisky

One Neat Whisky is a alcohol recommendation system. Our goal is to provide users an interface to find and discover new alcohol that they will enjoy.

## Tech used

Front-end tech:
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design)

Back-end tech:
- [Python](https://www.python.org)

## Current Scope and Future Plans

The initial scope of One Neat Whisky is use data that we have collected to present a large variety of alcohol present suggests based on what the likes.

Our v2 scope should include additional scrappers as well as some basic user functionality allowing us to collect data about what kind of alcohol users like. We intend to do this in a noisy way (ie. quizzes, ratings, etc).

## Setting up this repo

For all the jr dev's who are going to have to set up this repo after Patrick and I... We are sorry in advanced. We both agree that we are doing a really good job right now but if there is anything i have learned as a dev it is that the next person will certainly disagree XD

That said, should be easy enough;

```
npm install
```

then 

```
npx start
```

and we don't mix our package managers like a bunch of savages so... it should magically work.

If you intend to work on testing you will need to enure that cypress is set up on your computer. [this is the source I use to work with cypress,](https://www.cypress.io/) trust none else (except [stack overflow,](https://stackoverflow.com) when nothing seems to work).
